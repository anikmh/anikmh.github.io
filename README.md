## Brief Bio

I am a graduate student at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, working as a research assistant with Dr. Andrew W. Steiner in Theoretical Nuclear Astrophysics.

I completed my undergraduate in Physics at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2015. Then I moved to the United States for graduate studies. I obtained two MS degrees in Physics (2018) and Mathematics (2020) at the Ohio University, Athens, OH. After that, I joined UTK in 2020 and started my doctoral research in 2021.

I am currently working on the mass distributions of neutron stars in different binary systems and constraining the equation of state of dense matter. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation.
